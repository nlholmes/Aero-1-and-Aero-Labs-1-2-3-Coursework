Column definitions in propeller data file: No. of Props | Prop dia (in) | Prop Pitch (in) | Throttle | Q (psf) | V (Volts) | I (Amps) | Thrust (lb) | Torque (in-lb) | RPM | Material (1 - APC; 2- Wood)

Notes:
- Assume density = 1.18 kg/m^3 for your calculations. 
- If trust/torque is negative, set the efficiency value to 0.
