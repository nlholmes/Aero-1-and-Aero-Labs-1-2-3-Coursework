Column definitions in instrumentation_data_Q_POSX.dat: No. of Props | Prop dia (in) | Prop Pitch (in) | Throttle | Q (psf) | V (Volts) | I (Amps) | Thrust (lb) | Torque (in-lb) | RPM | Material (1 - APC; 2- Wood)

Notes:
- Assume density = 1.18 kg/m^3 for your calculations. 
- If trust/torque is negative, set the efficiency value to 0. 
- You will be presenting a total of 19 plots (7 plots for each propeller and 4 plots per parametric study) for the current lab report.
- Plot scatter plots instead of line plots as your data might have outliers.
- Provide your data processing codes in the Appendix.
