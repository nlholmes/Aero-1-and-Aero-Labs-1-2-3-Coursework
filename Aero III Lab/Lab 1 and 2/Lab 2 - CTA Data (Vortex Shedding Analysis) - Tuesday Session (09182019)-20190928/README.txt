Column definitions in voltage_time_history_Q_*_position_1.dat: time (seconds) | Eacq (V DC)

Notes:
- Assume density = 1.14 kg/m^3 for your calculations.
- Assume dynamic viscosity = 1.962e-5 kg/ms
- Cylinder diameter = 0.1016 m (4 inches)
- Focus on critial analysis. Point out and discuss interesting trends (if any) in the data.
- The processing code should be an input-output type code. The only input going into your code will be the raw data files provided (as is) and the output needs to be the final plots.
- Provide your data processing codes in the Appendix. Code efficiency will be tested and points will be allocated accordingly.
