Column definitions in the Tunnel-Turbulence_Run-*.dat files: P_transducer (psf) | I_sensor (mA)
Column definitions in the TF_vs_PerCentT.txt files: Turbulence Factor | Per cent turbulence

Notes:
- The *_Run-1_*.dat file has the data collected for the first run and *_Run-2_*.dat file has the data collected for the second run. 
- You are required to analyze both the runs separately and average out the final per cent turbulence obtained from both the runs.
- Extra credit will be given if you analyze all the data collected during the lab week to get a a more accurate measure of the per cent tunnel turbulence.
- The report needs to be in the AIAA prescribed format.
- All results in your final report need to be in SI units.
- Focus on critial analysis. Point out and discuss interesting trends (if any) in the data.
