Column definitions in the provided data files: P_transducer (psf) | h_manometer (inches) | I_sensor (mA) | T_transducer (degree F)

Notes:
- The *_Increasing-Velocity_*.dat file has the data collected for increasing velocities and *_Decreasing-Velocity_*.dat file has the data collected for decreasing velocities.
- All height readings from the manometer have an off-set. Remember to subtract the off-set based on the zero reading of the manometer from all the data points.
- The report needs to be in the AIAA prescribed format.
- All results in your final report need to be in SI units.
- As discussed in the lab, focus on critial analysis. Point out and discuss interesting trends (if any) in the data.
- In order to get the extra credit, you will have to present detailed analysis and plots.
