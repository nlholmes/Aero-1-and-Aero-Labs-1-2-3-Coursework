Each column in the z-loc_*.txt file corresponds to one reading.

Following data is provided in each column: 
- Row 1: Reading Number.
- Row 2: Y-location Index.
- Row 3: Z-location Index.
- Row 4 to 43: Physical Y-coordinate (in inches) of the 40 wake-rake probes.
- Row 44 to 83: Physical Z-coordinate (in inches) of the 40 wake-rake probes.
- Row 84 to 123: Gauge pressure readings (in psf) from Scanivalve system.
- Row 124: Freestream dynamic pressure reading (in psf) from wind-tunnel transducer.
- Row 125: Freestream temperature reading (in degree Fahrenheit) from wind-tunnel transducer.
- Row 126: Atmospheric (or freestream static) pressure reading (in inches of Hg) from barometer.
- Row 127: Time at which reading was collected.

Notes:
- The folder name corresponds to the dynamic pressure (in psf) at which the data was collected.
- 10 readings were taken at every position. 
- You are required to analyze the data for all positions and dynamic pressure settings.
- All results need to be presented in S.I. units.
- The report needs to be in the AIAA prescribed format.
- A single report will be submitted by each group.
- Details on the report requirements and the grading rubric have been provided in the project handout.
